      <span class="blog-card-title">Can LLMs Coordinate? A Simple Schelling Point Experiment</span>
      <span class="blog-card-desc">Testing whether five advanced AI models can coordinate on matching answers to 75 prompts without communication. Models excelled on concrete prompts like "a number between 1 and 10" (achieving perfect agreement on "7") but struggled with more abstract requests.</span>

      <span class="blog-card-title">Inference costs for hard coding tasks halve roughly every two months</span>
      <span class="blog-card-desc">Analysis of declining AI inference costs using WeirdML and Aider Polyglot benchmark data. The research shows that the cost to achieve a certain score halves roughly every two months—tasks that once cost dollars with GPT-4 can now be completed for fractions of a cent.</span>
