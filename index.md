# Håvard Tveit Ihle2

Welcome to my personal website! I’m an AI researcher and former astrophysicist currently working at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment. My primary interests lie in generalization, robustness, interpretability, and evaluation of machine learning models. Previously, I worked on data analysis for cosmological experiments (COMAP, Cosmoglobe), focusing on pipelines that process raw telescope data into constraints on astrophysical parameters.
